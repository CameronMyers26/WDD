       <em>Physics major, astrophysics minor. Senior</em>
       <p> I'm a transfer student from San Diego and I have greatly enjoyed my time here at Berkeley (as much as a physics major can enjoy school). My parents are both college dropouts so I'm very proud to have come as far as I have especially considering I've never really taken school seriously before. I only started taking physics classes because I enjoy learning about math and science. I've also found great enjoyment in many other things over the years which is partly why I'm taking this class. I've taken to writing a lot (another surprising thing as I always hated english class growing up) and I would like a place to post them. I am also a big music nerd and just recently have taken to catalogging albums.  </p>
