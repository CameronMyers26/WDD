       <em>Physics major, astrophysics minor. Senior</em>
       <p> I'm a transfer student from San Diego and I have greatly enjoyed my time here at Berkeley (as much as a physics major can enjoy school). My parents are both college dropouts so I'm very proud to have come as far as I have, especially considering I've never really taken school seriously before. I only started taking physics classes because I enjoy learning about math and science. I've also found great enjoyment in many other things over the years, which is partially why I'm taking this class. I've taken to writing a lot (another surprising thing as I always hated english class growing up) and I would like a place to post them. I am also a big music nerd and just recently have taken to cataloging albums. Most of the time I'm listening to a new album so its going to take a while to catch up. I know a decent bit of music theory and hope to use it someday, but that will have to wait as I am kept busy by schoolwork. I also tend to keep myself in shape by going to the gym regularly but this semester I have not been able to because I have too much going on already (hence the late homework submissions <small><small>my bad</small></small>). That's what I've been most focused on lately but I like picking up new things so thats just the tip of the iceberg, more or less.  </p>

         <li>The best way to learn design is to think like a designer. Keep in mind the purpose of details, because you know the designer must have done it for a reason. </li>
         <li>My favorite part of this article was when they were breaking down the design choices of apps. It gives you an idea of what to look for.</li>
         <li>"When I started off in design, I sucked." Everyone sucks at stuff when they just start. its only through these kinds of tactics that we can improve. </li>
